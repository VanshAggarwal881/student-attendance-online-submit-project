# student-attendance-online-submit-project
minor college project - student attendance online submission system made using tkinter in python.
1. main window is the welcome window code in which there are two fields one is student and the other is teacher and both are clickable to redirect the user to the next required window.
2. in welcome.py i have added the login and sign up code for student which i have provided in the other repositories, as soon as someone clicks on the student image on the welcome gui window it redirects him to that login page.
