# student-attendance-online-submit-project
minor college project - student attendance online submission system made using tkinter in python.
1. main window is the welcome window code in which there are two fields one is student and the other is teacher and both are clickable to redirect the user to the next required window.
2. in welcome.py i have added the login and sign up code for student login page which i have provided in the other repositories, as soon as someone clicks on the student image on the welcome gui window it redirects him to that student login page.
3. if the student has already saved its login details which he filled during signup... in the document.txt he will be redirected to the timetable window for attendance submission.
4. during attendance submission whenever the subject button of current day gets clicked, it asks for the name and roll number.
5. to prevent cheating it will match the name with the username you have filled during login if it matched, a messaage box of attendance submitted will popup, else the attendance will not get submitted.
6. once the student have submitted his attendance any teacher of the respective subject with a given username and a common password can see the name, roll number, day and subject present in the table.
